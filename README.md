# Test Project - Gift Card Purchasing Experience

## Due Date
~5/31/19

### Description

A customer lands on Goldbelly with the intent to purchase an e-gift card.
The user will need to provide a "from" name and email along with a "to" name and email. They will also need to select a value of the gift card which can be $25, $50, $100, $200 or they can enter their own value (up to $500).
This could all be a single page, or it could be done with multi-step modals. The flow is up to you for what you feel works best or is the most interesting.

### Technology

- Implement in React
- Try to match the site style of [Goldbelly.com](https://goldbelly.com) as much as possible, however please use your own class names and markup.

### Additional Information

Our current markup and class names we have for this experience is out of date anyways!
They will specifically be looking at the class naming conventions, CSS structure, and code quality. This code from this project will be utilized in the next meeting so they have some common code ground to talk through :)
